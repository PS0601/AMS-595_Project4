#  AMS 595 – Python Project 2  
### *Fractal Approximation, Markov Chains, and Taylor Series*

This project implements three independent computational tasks using Python — each illustrating a different mathematical concept:

1. **Task 1 – Mandelbrot Set:** Iterative fractal visualization  
2. **Task 2 – Markov Chain:** Convergence to stationary distribution  
3. **Task 3 – Taylor Series Approximation:** Symbolic and numerical function expansion  

All code was written as part of the **AMS 595: Fundamentals of Computing** course at **Stony Brook University**.

### Requirements
Ensure Python ≥ 3.8 is installed.  
Then, install the required packages:

### Run the file
python mandelbrot.py
python markov_chain.py
python taylor.py
